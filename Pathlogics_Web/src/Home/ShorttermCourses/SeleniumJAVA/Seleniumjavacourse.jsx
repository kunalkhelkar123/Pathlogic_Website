    title: 'Selenium Grid',
    description:
      'Selenium Grid lets you run tests on multiple machines or browsers at the same time, helping you save time and speed up your testing process. It\'s ideal for executing parallel tests across different environments, making cross-browser testing easier and more efficient.',

      'Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a browser plugin that lets you easily record and replay tests for web applications. Itâ€™s the most beginner-friendly Selenium tool, perfect for those new to automation. With its simple interface, you can create test scripts without writing any code and even tweak commands as needed.',

    description:
      'TestNG (Test Next Generation) is a popular testing framework for Java that\'s widely used alongside Selenium. It helps you organize tests better, control how they run, and automatically generate clean, detailed reports. With features like test grouping, prioritization, and running tests in parallel, it brings more structure and flexibility to your automation efforts.',

    description:
      'Cucumber is a tool used for Behavior Driven Development (BDD) that makes test automation more readable and collaborative. It lets you write test scenarios in plain English using the Gherkin language, so even non-technical team members can understand and contribute. When used with Selenium and Java, it bridges the gap between developers, testers, and business stakeholders.',
